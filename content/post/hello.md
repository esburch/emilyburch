First post on a new Hugo powered site! Look for more to come soon.

[Hugo](http://gohugo.io) is a great way to build a static website. I've been playing with the [beautifulhugo-theme](https://github.com/halogenica/beautifulhugo) and customizing it somewhat for this site. Since I use Markdown in my day-to-day job, Hugo has made it super simple to start adding content to my site.
